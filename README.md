# Secure User Management System Using Advanced Data Structures
  
1.Brief Project Description:
This project implements a secure user management system that facilitates user registration, login, password recovery, and credential management. It leverages multiple data structures to efficiently handle user data, login attempts, recovery requests, and relationships.


2.Problem Statement:
Managing user data securely and efficiently is a significant challenge in software systems. Traditional approaches lack modularity, scalability, and robust error handling, making them unsuitable for secure applications. The use of data structures like stacks, queues, and trees ensures optimized storage, retrieval, and security of user credentials.
